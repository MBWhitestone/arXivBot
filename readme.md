# arŒßivBot, the arXiv Discord bot.
![demo image](demo.png)

Save your team the trouble of searching for the most recent research papers.
Deploy arŒßivBot and get a Discord message for every paper submitted to
[arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) that might be relevant according to your own
preferences.

To [activate the bot](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html):
1. üöÄ make a new application in the
[Discord activation portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications),
[create a bot](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html#creating-a-bot-account) and
[add it](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html#inviting-your-bot) to your Discord server.
2. üõÇ Copy the bot's key into a file called `key.py` which has the following contents:
   ```
    key = "<YOUR_SECRET_BOT_KEY_GOES_HERE>"
    ```
    Alternatively you an add a key in `cfg.yml`.
1. üì¶ Make sure you have installed the necessary Python packages (see `requirements.txt`) in your Python environment.
2. ‚ö°Ô∏è Run `python3 bot.py`.
3. üéâ Enjoy.

Have a look at `cfg.yml` for a bunch of parameters you can tweak, or just ask arŒßivBot to do it for you via its Discord interface. In the default setting the bot will respond to messages starting with `!arXiv`.
